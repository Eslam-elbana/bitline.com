# Bit-Line (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a ready-to-run frontend project for the Bit-Line website.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies

npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

## Notes
- This project includes placeholder SVG logos (inside `public/images/`) for 22 programs.
- For real download files and Firebase integration (auth, storage), replace placeholders in `src/pages/Programs.jsx` and add your Firebase config.
- Tailwind is configured; if you want Tailwind to work locally, ensure PostCSS & Tailwind are installed (already listed in package.json devDependencies).
